## Story Overview

### Premise

**Thornhaven** is a small village being slowly strangled by the **Iron Hollow Gang**, a bandit group that extorts merchants, robs travelers, and terrorizes anyone who resists. The village isn't occupied—it's *compliant*. Fear has become routine.

The player arrives as an **outsider** with no predetermined allegiance. Their reason for being in Thornhaven is their own. What they discover is a web of secrets, compromises, and moral complexity that will force them to make choices with permanent consequences.

### The Hidden Truth

What no one knows: **Gregor, the village merchant, orchestrated this arrangement.**

Years ago, when the bandits first appeared, Gregor made a deal:
- He provides supplies, weapons, and intelligence
- In return, his shop thrives while others fail
- He gains influence over the fearful town council
- Most importantly: **Elena, his daughter, is untouchable**

The price of this "peace" is paid by everyone else.

### Genre & Tone

- **Fantasy/Medieval** - Similar to classic Zelda/Link aesthetics
- **Morally Complex** - No pure heroes or villains
- **Player Agency** - Every major character can die, be saved, or be corrupted
- **Consequences Matter** - Choices ripple through the world permanently

### Player Role

- **Origin:** Outsider arriving in Thornhaven
- **Motivation:** Player-defined (curiosity, bounty hunting, passing through, etc.)
- **Agency:** Full freedom to help, harm, manipulate, or ignore any faction

## The World State

### When The Player Arrives

| Aspect | Surface Appearance | Hidden Reality |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Village** | Quiet, peaceful | Suffocating under fear |
| **Gregor's Shop** | Most prosperous | Profits from bandit deal |
| **The Tavern** | Nearly empty | Mira knows too much, says nothing |
| **The Smithy** | Steady work | Unknowingly arms the bandits |
| **Town Council** | Paralyzed | Too afraid to act |
| **Peacekeepers** | Undermanned | Demoralized, outmatched |

### The Iron Hollow Gang

- **Location:** Forest camp outside village (Iron Hollow)
- **Leader:** [TBD - Design needed]
- **Strength:** 15-20 armed bandits
- **Methods:** Extortion, robbery, intimidation, occasional violence
- **Goal:** Profit and control, not destruction

### Timeline Before Player Arrives

| Years Ago | Event |
|-----------|-------|
| 8 | Gregor establishes shop in Thornhaven |
| 5 | Elena's mother dies (illness) |
| 4 | Iron Hollow Gang forms in the forest |
| 3 | Bandits begin harassing village |
| 3 | Gregor makes his deal with bandits |
| 2 | Mira's husband killed by bandits |
| 1 | Village accepts "protection" arrangement |
| Now | Player arrives |

## Central Conflict

### Gregor's Triangle of Guilt

```
              [ELENA'S SAFETY]
                    /\
                   /  \
                  /    \
                 /      \
                /   HIS  \
               /  SECRET  \
              /____________\
    [PROFIT]                [POWER]
                  |
           [VILLAGE SUFFERS]
```

**The Moral Complexity:**

Gregor isn't evil—he's a father who made a deal with devils to protect his daughter. Every day the village suffers is a day Elena lives free. He justifies it as "necessary" but the guilt is destroying him.

This creates player choices with no clean answers:
- Expose him? Elena is devastated, village gets justice
- Blackmail him? You become complicit
- Kill him? Elena may never forgive you
- Protect his secret? The village never heals

---

### SUPPORTING CHARACTERS

#### Town Council (Elders)
- 3-5 elderly villagers who govern
- Paralyzed by fear, look to anyone for leadership
- Can be rallied with evidence and a plan

#### Peacekeepers (Voluntary Corps)
- 5-8 villagers who try to maintain order
- Undermanned, poorly equipped, demoralized
- Can be armed and motivated with player help

#### Villagers (Civilians)
- Various townsfolk going about their lives
- React to player reputation and story events
- Some may have minor quests or information

#### Bandit Leader - THE BOSS (SPOILER)

> **MAJOR PLOT TWIST - Development Use Only**

**The Boss is Mira.**

The grieving widow running The Rusty Nail tavern is actually the mastermind behind Iron Hollow. Everything about her public persona is carefully constructed:

| Surface | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| Widow grieving Marcus | Marcus either never existed or was eliminated when he became a liability |
| Afraid of bandits | Orchestrates all bandit operations |
| Knows Gregor is informant | She recruited him; "saw him meeting bandits" is misdirection |
| Wants justice | Wants power and control over the region |
| Inn is failing | Money flows to Iron Hollow; inn is a front |

**Reveal Conditions:**

| Condition | Reveal Type | Emotional Impact |
|-----------|-------------|------------------|
| **Successful romance** | Mira confesses after deep trust is established | Intimate betrayal, player chose love over signs |
| **Failed romance / low trust** | Cruel reveal during Act III confrontation | She unmasks as the player storms Iron Hollow |
| **Player joins bandits** | Varn introduces them to "the Boss" | Player meets her in her true role |

**Story Implications:**
- Varn works for Mira, not despite her
- Mira "witnessed" Marcus's death because she ordered it (or faked it entirely)
- Her information about Gregor is real - she's his handler, not a witness
- Her fear is an act; her grief may be partially real (complicated feelings about Marcus)
- The romance path becomes a tragedy - she may genuinely fall for the player, creating conflict with her role

**Why This Works:**
1. **Subverts expectations** - The sympathetic widow trope is weaponized
2. **Explains her knowledge** - Of course she knows everything; she runs the operation
3. **Creates devastating choice** - Love vs duty if player discovers truth mid-romance
4. **Reward/punishment structure** - Romance reveal is "softer" than antagonist reveal

**Implementation Notes:**
- Mira's personality file should NOT reveal this (it's her cover persona)
- The Boss persona needs separate handling (later implementation)
- Varn's personality knows Mira is the Boss but will never reveal this (unbreakable secret)
- Need to update Varn's `unbreakable_secrets` when implementing
